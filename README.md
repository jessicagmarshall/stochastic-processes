# ECE302: Probability Models & Stochastic Processes
### An assortment of homework assignments for the Spring 2017 section at The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art.

Topics in probability, random variables and stochastic processes applied to the fields of electrical and computer engineering. Probability, events, random variables, expectation, moments, characteristic functions, conditional probability and expectation. Functions of random variables, random vectors, Gausian random vectors, Poisson points. Bounding and limit theorems. Relations among important distributions and probability models.Stochastic processes: stationarity, ergodicity, Brownian motion, Markov processes. Deterministic systems with stochastic inputs, correlation and power spectral density, ARMA models. Hilbert space and applications: orthogonality principle, discrete Wiener and Kalman filters, linear prediction, lattice filters.
